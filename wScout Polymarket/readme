----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are all the wScout scripts that interact with Polymarket, using their CLOB API and Gamma Markets API
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Events script retrieves the most recent 100 active AND open markets from https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets
The CLOBmarkets script retrieves all active and open markets, through a connection with the Polymarket Central Limit Orderbook. Requires:
  - RPC connection, https://polygon-rpc.com
  - Private key / Wallet

Both scripts output raw JSON data, to be processed.
