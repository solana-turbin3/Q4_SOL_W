These are all the wScout scripts that interact with Polymarket, using their CLOB API and Gamma Markets API

The Events script retrieves the most recent 100 active AND open markets from https://gamma-api.polymarket.com/markets
The CLOBmarkets script retrieves all active and open markets, through a connection with the Polymarket Central Limit Orderbook. Requires:
  - RPC connection, https://polygon-rpc.com
  - Private key / Wallet

Both scripts output raw JSON data, to be processed.
