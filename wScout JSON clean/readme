These two scripts clean the raw json data retrieved from the different scraping / API scripts.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have included old JSON data in all_markets.json, which can be used to test the two scripts. 
Please keep in mind that these markets are now closed, and therefore don't have a bid and ask

JSON clean outputs it into the following format:
  market: string
  asset_id: string
  hash: string
  timestamp: string
  bids Ordersummary[]
  asks Ordersummary[]

JSON clean2 outputs it into the following format:
  Event ID
  Event Time
  Market type
  Side A
    1. Name
    2. Odds
  Side B
    1. Name
    2. Odds
  (Side C)
    1. (Name)
    2. (Odds)


**Side C is applicable to events such as Soccer games, where there is a third outcome, DRAW**
